> **ðŸ“– [Using Query Parameters](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/01-Query-Parameters)**

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

It is a way to manually append a URL to access, or search for, the desired results.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

It begins with a ? followed by a statement = value(s). 
You can string several of them together, and differentiate them, using the & operator.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

    When there are a large number of categories being able to modify the url on the fly would come in very useful.
    It can be used to filter things down or introduce additional context to a request.
