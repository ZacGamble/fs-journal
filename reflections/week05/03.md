## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Giving yourself a pre-determined block of time to work, not going over.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Set a timer for 45min and take a break when it finishes.
Get up and either take a break or ask for help if I'm stuck for more than 30min.
If I complete a feature, I should take a walk.


3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?

Yesterday I got stuck and "spun my wheels" far more than I should have. 
Stepping away and asking for help would have helped this week.
