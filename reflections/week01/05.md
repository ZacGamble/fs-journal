# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
It all went fairly well I'd say. I had fun.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
I find myself actually enjoying styling.

- What are you struggling with?
Remembering/knowing what bootstrap classes exist and what their limitations are.
I was writing custom classes that were excessive and could have been BS5 shorthand instead. 

- What would you count as a victory?
Having fun with the checkpoint, I didn't feel too stressed out about it.
