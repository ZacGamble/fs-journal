## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Identifying all the "boxes" in a page before adding content. That way you have a more methodical approach 
as opposed to randomly completing tasks.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
Mozilla documentation and bootstrap documentation. It is also helpful to look at pre-existing popular websites
and using the chrome developer tool to get an idea of their page structuring.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good design isn't simply utilitarian, it is art. 
A well engineered page will keep people's attention and draw the user in.
