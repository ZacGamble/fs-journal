## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
Wire-framing might be considered  something of a "rough-draft" in web design.
It gives the developer some goalposts and visible structure to follow.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There is the "low-res" version and the "high-res" version. The former is a basic scaffolding to determine layout,
while the latter is more specific and feature complete.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Yes, I think that good planning is essential. Maybe not so much for our clone work, but designing a site from the ground up would benefit greatly from wire-framing.
