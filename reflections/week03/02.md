## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

    It helps reduce concurrent dependency failures resulting in unstable applications. 
    It also helps ease the implementation of mutable data structures if they need to be modified.
    Preventing bugs and reducing the tight coupling is another benefit.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
    There was too much reliance on convention and it wasn't necessarily enforced private scope.
    Underscored methods are intended to be called indirectly so an implementation change can break things unintentionally.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
    They can be written within classes/class fields. This was the hierarchy of our MCVs pattern is clearly understood and workable.
