# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

The MVC concepts were a lot to take in, but I feel like I have a decent grasp on it now conceptually.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

- What are you struggling with?

How the one-to-many class relationships wor. 
How to access and modify the specific properties of a specific class instance.

- What would you count as a victory?

Getting my class objects to render in the correct positions and relative to their assigned parent element.
