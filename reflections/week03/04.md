> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

    It enables one-to-many data binding so that multiple elements can remain in sync.
    When users interact with elements on the page JavaScript needs a way to react to these events.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

    The subscribe to record new observable events.
    The unsubscribe which removes observable events.
    Lastly is the broadcast which executes all events with 'bound' data.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

It allows you to 'observe' large sets of data, such as an array of class objects, and execute a method whenever this data changes states. This way you can conveniently manage much bigger programs with neat code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It is important to pay close attention to what the project requirements are and build out the wire-frame/hardcoded model to a satisfactory degree. Also, once again, I must be sure to use consistent naming, spelling, & CASING in my HTML.
