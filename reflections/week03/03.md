## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
    The handler is used to handle setters and getters. 
    It sets 'traps' that are triggered whenever an object property is accessed, allowing an extra layer of validation before letting data be manipulated.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

    You must return the value of the key being accessed inside the handler object.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

    THe proxy object, from what I understand thus far, acts as a data flow control abstraction layer. It wraps around the underlying 'AppState' file and enables a degree of security and view request management opportunities.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Be absolutely sure to spell things correctly and consistently. 
The more complex a program becomes the easier a simple misspelling or poorly named variable can ruin things.
I would have made much more progress today had I simply spelled my classes and IDs consistently.
