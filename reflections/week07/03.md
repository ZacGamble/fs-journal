## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

User experience could be described as the quality of interactions with a website.
Whenever developing client-facing software, a high standard should be set for helping the user feel as though they are in control of making the decisions.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

It makes using the web app much smoother and enjoyable.
Although it may be in many cases just a matter of perception.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

It is not just important, it is paramount. I immediately leave ugly, bloated, or unattractive websites and I'm sure others do as well.
Good design will lure people in and hold their attention much longer.
