## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Be respectful and use the partner programming. Think about the user's experience when creating the UI/UX.

2. What went well this week?

We got the backend done in just three hours putting us well ahead of schedule. This gave some breathing room and time to spend on styling and ensuring good functionality.

3. What would you do differently?

Not sure I would do anything differently. 
It went well and I'm satisfied with how the project ended up.
