# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

It was a good chance to solidify my understanding of the MVC pattern and encapsulation in general.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
Just how many incredible API resources are available online for developers to play with.

- What are you struggling with?
Making requests with APIs was quite confusing to me at first.

- What would you count as a victory?

Getting the checkpoint done before Sunday.
