## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

Representational state transfer. It means that when the API is called its sends data "representative" of the requested resource.

2. What does Stateless mean?

It basically means the API holds no memory of a user's past interactions and calls.
Everything needed exists within the request, then a response is made, and nothing is saved.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

An identifier for what you're looking for, the URL. Also known as the endpoint.
The resource you want from the server, in the form of an HTTP method.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
    Aliasing, or filtering to 'reduced' data maps from raw API response data makes it much more legible going forward. Plus it is easier syntactically accessing its properties or defining new ones in the class model(s).
