## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, resolved, and rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

They provide a cleaner and easier way to resolve asynchronous requests without so many nested callback functions.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

    .then() passes along to the next response whereas .catch() triggers the failure callback.
