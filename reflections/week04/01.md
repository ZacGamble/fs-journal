> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

The expectation is for code to execute from top down, however JavaScript doesn't necessarily behave this way.
This can result in messy code.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Async means it will take some time to complete the request, and it doesn't return a value instantly.
Instead of halting the program to complete an expensive task it awaits in the background and executes when ready.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keep the code shallow, modularize, and handle every single error.

The first two are mainly just ways to keep code readable and clean, but also makes it possible to export entire modules and more easily reference back. 
Handling errors means assuming every callback function will fail and building around that assumption. Don't make it easy to ignore potentially crippling errors. Catch them immediately.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Pulling information from a third-party using async get methods enables access to lots of useful and/or interesting data without needing it to exist on the local machine. 

Its important to perform these network pings asynchronously as to avoid callback and timeout issues.
