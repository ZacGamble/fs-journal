## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

    The information in a column is a specific property of a schema, or a data type.
    The information in a row is a given instance of the model or schema.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age TEXT,
    description TEXT
) default charset utf8;


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Delete from will remove a selected row item. 
Drop table removes an entire (schema) collection from a database.
