1. What is a List in C#?

It is a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by their index.
Similar to an array in JavaScript, .NET provides methods such as sort, filter, and find in lists.

Add and remove.
These two are likely the most fundamental to the funtionality of a C# list.

List.find(i => i.id == id)
Or if I know its index I can use bracket notation [7].
