## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. They lend themselves to cleaner code.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You must explicitly cast an enum, and it cannot be changed during runtime.
You could cast int variable into enum but I'm not sure why you would want to.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have used them in a mongoDB schema to define potential prop categories.
If I wanted a constant value that is also immutable an enum seems like a good option.
