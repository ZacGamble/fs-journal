## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

In C# there are value types, reference types, and pointer types.
Value types are variables with directly assigned values.
Reference types store the address in memory where the referenced value is stored.
Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Value types are directly assigned a value. The main difference between C# and JS is the fact that it is strictly typed. Instead of declaring such a variable with let or const keywords you can declare it by its data type.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types

Reference types such as an array are "references" to the stored data address. They are accessed by referencing the position in a collection. Value types conversely are called directly by their variable name.
