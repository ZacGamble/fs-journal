## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Testing generally involves trying everything imaginable to break the program.
This will show how resilient and durable the software is and highlights bugs that need fixing.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

Testing ensures that your program, and more specifically each method, is working as intended.
Once you have tested something rigorously you can trust it to be a stable area in an otherwise uncharted land.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

One potential problem is if the tests are written poorly they may not capture edge cases, or may be hard to understand.
Another possible issue is simply the time it takes to implement them initially, although they will likely save time overall.
