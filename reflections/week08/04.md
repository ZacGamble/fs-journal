## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

There is unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

At the highest level, I think E2E testing is the most useful. 
Unit and component testing are important while building each feature, but they don't ensure all parts are working together holistically.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing. So far components work exactly as I intend, with the exception of v-for props.
Individual methods however can be quite difficult to debug and get functioning correctly.
