## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Hooks are used to determine both when a component is initialized and under what circumstances they are reactive.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

In the Nasa challenge, I used the onMounted() hook to initialize an api.get request, as opposed to a class constructor.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks are basically triggers that tell a component to load immediately before or after first render. 
They are commonly used for firing off network requests upon page load, or anytime you have methods activating behind the scenes. (As a component is first launched)
