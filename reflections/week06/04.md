## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A nested route is when you have a pathing setup with multiple subroutes (children) within.
That can allow greater control and organization.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

A nested route would be useful anytime you have a large subset of similar pages. 
Keeping with the travel theme, consider rental cars on a travel website. 
Bundling their routes based on category, IE SUV, Truck, Sedan, etc.., could help organize navigation.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Nested routes are almost exactly the same as a normal route. 
The main difference being they are scoped to their parent, and act to extend the parent's URL. They can take in properties from the parent route in a similar fashion as components.

Vue's router-links and dynamic rendering breathe life into our formerly boring static websites.
The ability to generate so many components and pages quickly allows greater complexity.
