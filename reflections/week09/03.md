## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

An inlined image encoded in a binary format represented by four 6-bit base-64 digits.
It allows an image file to be embedded directly into the HTML/CSS of a document.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

It has an increased download size relative to the original format.
Base 64 needs to be decoded before it is read, therefor demands a larger CPU overhead.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past, HTTP was very limited in the size and number of network requests that could be made.
Base-64 images could be loaded in as plain text alleviating this issue.
However, modern browsers are orders of magnitude faster and the large text and decoding overhead do more harm than good.
