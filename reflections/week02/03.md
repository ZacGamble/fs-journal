## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main way is calling the console.log() method. This allows printing a string message and/or the returned value of a function for testing. The browser console also prints error messages automatically that are very useful.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab shows the pages HTML and CSS. It also has "element view" that highlights the content, padding, and margin of an element's box model as it appears on the page.
Its also helpful for making on the fly adjustments, particularly to incremental number values.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using a debugger in the IDE or in the browser's dev tools.  This allows you to step through each line of code and determine exactly where the problem is occurring.
