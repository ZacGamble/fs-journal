## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

You can declare a function using the 'function' keyword. This allows passing in parameters and reusing the code later.

Another technique is to write an expression using arrow syntax. This is also known as an anonymous function. Good for compact code when you don't need it again later.
Lastly is a function expression defined by first declaring a variable and assigning it to a function. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are names defined in the function that act as placeholders to pass in values.
Arguments are the actual pieces of data being passed into the function and operated upon.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher order functions have a greater degree of abstraction. They can take in other functions as arguments or return them.
