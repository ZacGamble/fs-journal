## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Scope describes how 'visible' a piece of data is. Global scope allows a variable to be accessed by other functions, local scope limits the data to its own function.

2. What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is where JS moves variables declared with var keyword to the top of their scope. This allows functions to access the data even when perhaps unintended. That is why let and const are the preferred method.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Use let when you want a variable's value to be re-assigned later.
Use const when you want a variable to maintain a constant value.
Var works similarly to let but is considered bad form and should generally be avoided.
