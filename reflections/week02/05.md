# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I have become familiarized with basic JavaScript and enjoyed the learning process.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

The topic of even a single programming language is incredibly deep.
Its amazing how much more there is to learn.

- What are you struggling with?

Getting the desired results from for-in loops was something I struggled with. I eventually had to just try a different approach to get the functionality I wanted even though it is less condense code.

- What would you count as a victory?

Getting the logic to work as intended is a very satisfying moment.
